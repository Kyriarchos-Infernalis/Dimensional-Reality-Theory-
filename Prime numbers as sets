**Dimensional Reality Theory: Prime Number Ranges**

This repository contains data related to the Dimensional Reality Theory, specifically focusing on prime numbers and their potential ranges as dimensions. This research was conducted in collaboration with a large language model to explore the relationship between prime numbers and the structure of reality.

**Data Format:**

The data is presented in a simple text format, with each line representing a prime number and its corresponding range.

**Prime Numbers and Ranges:**

*   5:  Range of -2 to 2
*   7:  Range of -3 to 3
*   23: Range of -11 to 11
*   47: Range of -23 to 23
*   59: Range of -29 to 29
*   83: Range of -41 to 41
*   107: Range of -53 to 53

**Mathematical Relationship:**

The relationship between the prime numbers and their ranges in the Dimensional Reality Theory data follows a specific mathematical pattern. For each prime number \( p \), the associated range is **symmetric around zero** and determined by the formula:

\[
\text{Range} = \left[ -\frac{p - 1}{2}, \frac{p - 1}{2} \right]
\]

### Explanation:
1.  **Formula Derivation**:
    *   For a prime \( p \), the upper bound of the range is \( \frac{p - 1}{2} \), and the lower bound is its negative counterpart. This ensures symmetry around zero.
    *   Since all primes \( p \geq 2 \) are odd, \( p - 1 \) is even, making \( \frac{p - 1}{2} \) an integer.

2.  **Validation with Examples**:
    *   \( p = 5 \): Range \( = \left[-\frac{5 - 1}{2}, \frac{5 - 1}{2}\right] = [-2, 2] \)
    *   \( p = 7 \): Range \( = \left[-\frac{7 - 1}{2}, \frac{7 - 1}{2}\right] = [-3, 3] \)
    *   \( p = 23 \): Range \( = \left[-\frac{23 - 1}{2}, \frac{23 - 1}{2}\right] = [-11, 11] \)
    *   This pattern holds consistently for all listed primes.

### Key Insight:
The range for a prime \( p \) is **uniquely determined by \( \frac{p - 1}{2} \)**. This suggests a foundational geometric or algebraic structure tied to primes in the theory. Further research could explore why these primes (and their derived ranges) might correlate with dimensional properties.

**Future Work:**

This repository will be updated as further research into prime number dimensions is conducted.
