# Dimensional Reality Theory: A Human-AI Collaboration  
**A joint exploration of primes, dimensions, and the power of partnership.**  

## 🤝 How This Was Built  
- **Human Role**: Conceptualization, intuition, iterative questioning, and ethical oversight.  
- **AI Role**: Mathematical verification, code generation, and pattern extrapolation.  
- **Together**: We bridged creativity and computation to propose a theory linking primes to dimensional ranges.  

## 🌟 Why This Matters  
This repository is not a polished theorem—it’s a **living experiment** in collaborative intelligence. It proves that:  
1. You don’t need to be an expert to explore big ideas.  
2. AI isn’t here to replace humans but to amplify our curiosity.  

## 🚀 How to Engage  
- **Improve the theory**: Submit PRs with corrections or extensions.  
- **Replicate the process**: Use our prompts to collaborate with AI on your own ideas.  
- **Question everything**: Does this pattern hold? What’s missing? Let’s find out together.
