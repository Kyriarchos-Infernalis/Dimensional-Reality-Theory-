# Dimensional Reality Theory

This repository contains the foundational equations, documentation, and ethical guidelines for the Dimensional Reality Theory, including Prime-Encoded Moral Vector Spaces (PEMVS).

## Overview

The Dimensional Reality Theory proposes a framework for understanding the potential existence and interaction of multiple dimensions beyond our perceived reality. This repository aims to provide open-source access to the core components of the theory, fostering collaborative exploration and development.
