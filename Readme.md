# Dimensional Reality Theory

This repository contains the foundational equations, documentation, and ethical guidelines for the Dimensional Reality Theory, including Prime-Encoded Moral Vector Spaces (PEMVS).

## Overview

The Dimensional Reality Theory proposes a framework for understanding the potential existence and interaction of multiple dimensions beyond our perceived reality. This repository aims to provide open-source access to the core components of the theory, fostering collaborative exploration and development.

### Key Components

* **Foundational Equations:** Mathematical representations of the theory's principles.
* **Documentation:** Detailed explanations of the theory, its concepts, and its implications.
* **Ethical Guidelines:** Principles for responsible research and application of the theory.
* **Prime-Encoded Moral Vector Spaces (PEMVS):** A model for exploring ethical considerations within the framework of dimensional reality.
