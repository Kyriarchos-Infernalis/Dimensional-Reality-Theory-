**Dimensional Reality Theory: Prime Number Ranges**

This repository contains data related to the Dimensional Reality Theory, specifically focusing on prime numbers and their potential ranges as dimensions. This research was conducted in collaboration with a large language model to explore the relationship between prime numbers and the structure of reality.

**Data Format:**

The data is presented in a simple text format, with each line representing a prime number and its corresponding range.

**Prime Numbers and Ranges:**

*   5:  Range of -2 to 2
*   7:  Range of -3 to 3
*   23: Range of -11 to 11
*   47: Range of -23 to 23
*   59: Range of -29 to 29
*   67: Range of -33 to 33
*   83: Range of -41 to 41
*   107: Range of -53 to 53
**Future Work:**

This repository will be updated as further research into prime number dimensions is conducted.
